            <h2>1 Nephi 2:16</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also
                having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he
                did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my
                father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.</p>

            <h2>2 Nephi 28:21</h2>
            <p>And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in
                Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is wellâ€”and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away
                carefully down to hell.</p>
